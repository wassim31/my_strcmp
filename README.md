implementation of my own strcmp function to understand more the topic of : Strings and pointers in C.

The function returns true if the strings are similars , and false if they aren't.

To input the strings , use command lines arguments.
This how you compile & use the program :
# gcc -o main my_strcmp.c
# ./main <your_first_string> <your_second_string>
